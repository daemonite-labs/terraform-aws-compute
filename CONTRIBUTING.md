# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Here's how you can contribute:

## Ways to contribute

* **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open a new issue on GitHub. Be sure to include clear steps to reproduce the bug, your environment (operating system, software versions, etc.), and any relevant error messages.
* **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Feel free to open an issue to discuss it. Please provide as much detail as possible about your suggestion and its potential benefits.
* **Submitting Pull Requests:** If you've fixed a bug or implemented a new feature, you can submit a pull request (PR). Please follow these guidelines:
  * **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
  * **Create a new branch** for your changes. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-new-feature`).
  * **Make your changes** following the project's coding style and conventions.
  * **Write clear and concise commit messages.** Each commit should address a single logical change.
  * **Test your changes thoroughly.** Ensure that your changes don't introduce new issues and that existing tests still pass. If applicable, add new tests to cover your changes.
  * **Keep your pull request focused.** If you have multiple unrelated changes, please submit separate PRs.
  * **Ensure your branch is up-to-date** with the main repository's `main` (or `master`) branch before submitting your PR. You can do this by rebasing your branch onto the latest `main`.
  * **Clearly describe your changes** in the pull request description. Explain the problem your PR solves or the feature it adds.
* **Improving Documentation:** Help us make the project more accessible by improving the documentation. This could include fixing typos, clarifying explanations, adding examples, or creating new documentation. You can submit documentation changes via pull requests.
